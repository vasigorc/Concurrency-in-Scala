  * Exercise 1 Implement a command-line program that asks the user to input

  * time that the user hits ENTER and the time that the HTML is retrieved, the
  * program should repetitively print a . to the standard output every 50 milliseconds
  * , with a 2 second timeout. Use only futures and promises, and avoid synchronization
  * primitives from the previous chapters. You may reuse the timeout method defined
  * in this chapter.
